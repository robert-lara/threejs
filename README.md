## Compile Application

This command will use webpack to compile the application and place it into the dist/ folder
```
npx webpack 
```

Note: Do not forget to add the index.html file to the dist/ directory

```
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
   <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8" />
     <title>Getting Started</title>
   </head>
   <body>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
   </body>
 </html>
```

To run the application, launch your server and reference the dist directory. You can use Live Server extension with Visual Studio Code
